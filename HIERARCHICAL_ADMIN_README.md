# Angular Announcement Portal with Hierarchical Admin System

## 🎯 Project Overview

This Angular application implements a comprehensive announcement portal with a sophisticated hierarchical admin system based on the UP Irrigation Department structure. The system supports role-based permissions, CRUD operations, and a complete administrative hierarchy.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Hierarchical Admin System
The application implements a 10-level administrative hierarchy:

1. **Hon'ble Minister** (Level 1) - Highest authority
2. **Principal Secretary** (Level 2) 
3. **Chief Engineer (Coordination)** (Level 3)
4. **Chief Engineer (Technical)** (Level 4)
5. **Superintending Engineer** (Level 5)
6. **Executive Engineer** (Level 6)
7. **Assistant Engineer** (Level 7)
8. **Junior Engineer** (Level 8)
9. **Technical Assistant** (Level 9)
10. **Clerical Staff** (Level 10) - Entry level

### Permission Framework
- **View Permissions**: Admins can view announcements from same or lower levels
- **Edit Permissions**: Admins can edit their own announcements and those from subordinates
- **Delete Permissions**: Admins can delete their own announcements and those from subordinates
- **Upload Permissions**: All authenticated admins can create announcements
